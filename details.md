# Portfolio Plans (Preview)

## Portfolio Plans
**View portfolio level work items across projects.** Portfolio Plans is an organizational tool that allows you to pull Epics from any project and team within organization and plots on them on an easy to read timeline view. This helps teams drive cross-project visibility and alignment by tracking portfolio level work.

## Hand-pick portfolio items to track

Getting started is easy. First, create a new plan. Then, select a project and add the item(s) you wish to track on the plan. You may add as many work items as you want and from multiple projects.

## Track the progress of work in flight

Once all the portfolio items are pulled in, visualize the work in a scrollable gantt chart calendar view. You can drag and drop to adjust the dates. Additionally, you can view the rollup of progress for each item. In settings, select whether you want to track progress using completed count or effort. Drill down into the epic to view the feature timeline.
